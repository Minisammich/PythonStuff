My Wow Factor for Assignment 2 is the added cleanliness, conciseness, and visual appeal of all my answers to the questions 2 and 3.

For Question 2, I used TeX to make the title look proper, and converted floats to ints if the value was an integer to stop the decimal
points from displaying in the title. I also used comments to visually split the code into sections to make it easier to see where along 
the code you are, and which parts are doing what parts of the program.

For Question 3, I also used comments to visually split the code.
