CMPT 142 Assignment 1 - Wow Factor

For the Wow Factor of my assignment, I have made some minor and some major improvements to the overall
function of each program 1-4.

The improvement in Question 1, is that if the adjective you choose starts with the letter "A", it will put
the word "an" into the sentence, and if the adjective does not start with an "A", it will put "a" instead of "an."
For example: "He ran into an angry aardvark..." or "He ran into a hungry hippo..."
I find that having the incorrect form is distracting, and so I felt it was necessary to make it correct.

The improvement in Question 2, is that it will not only tell you the total price of the fuel needed for the roadtrip,
but the volume of fuel that will be consumed, and the efficiency of the car is converted from MPG to L/100km, which could be
helpful for comparing it with other people to know how efficient your car is relative to others here in Canada.

The improvement in Question 3 is relatively minor, it simply also tells you the total square metres of wall and roof that will
need to be painted along with the total cost of the paint needed.

The improvement in Question 4, is that it will not accept your username until you accept that it is truncated, and if they don't
accept that it will be truncated, it asks you to put in a new username.

These minor improvements may not be much on their own, but all together I think they add up to be a pretty good wow factor.
